== New features ==

* Support for a bittorrent variant of the viriatum server
* Ass support for a directory on ini files (configuration.d) so that all files there are read in sequence (usefull for modules configuration)
* Support for OpenSSL with non blocking sockets (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5397788/confused-about-openssl-non-blocking-i-o https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/mailing.openssl.users/nJRF_JVnPkc)
* Support for the SPDY protocol (http://dev.chromium.org/spdy)
* Support for async file reading (http://linux.die.net/man/3/aio_read http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365747(v=vs.85).aspx http://lxr.evanmiller.org/http/source/os/unix/ngx_aio_read.c http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-async/) 
* Support for Python embedding (mod_python)
* Support for WSGI (mod_wsgi)
* Support for Google V8 (mod_v8) 
* Support for HTTP ranges (http://www.web-polygraph.org/docs/userman/ranges.html)
* Support for configuration using parsing of json (https://github.com/json-c/json-c) or any other in (http://www.json.org)
* Support for the buffering to support the request object based on the nginx implementation (http://www.slideshare.net/joshzhu/nginx-internals)
* Apply the famous http parser of node.js http://github.com/ry/http-parser
* Support for huffman compression according to the implementation in the mariachi engine (http://code.google.com/p/mariachi/source/browse/src/hive_mariachi/algorithms/compression/huffman.h)
* Implement the memory pool structure based on the nginx implementation

== Refactor / Bug Fixing ==

* Implement and refactor win32 conditions (_thread_win32.c) use this link http://thbecker.net/free_software_utilities/fair_monitor_for_win32/start_page.html

== Design decisions ==

* Create a structure similiar to the asynchronous model defined in the colony service implementations
* Separate the concept of service from the handler of the select (select_service does not make sensess)

== Performance refactor ==

* Remove the strlen references and use String_t structures to reduce size calculations (in constant access situations)

== Target performance ==

* ab -n 10000 -c 100 -k http://servidor2.hive:9090/error should be able to run at 45K-60K requests per second (using file handler)
* ab -n 10000 -c 100 -k  http://srio.hive:9090/eclipse should be able to run at 15K-24K requests per second raw power (not confirmed)
