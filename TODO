== New features ==

* Support for a template language for the directory listing
* Support for configuration using parsing of json (https://github.com/json-c/json-c) or any other in (http://www.json.org)
* Support for lua embedding
* Support for Python embedding
* Create infra-structure for error handling base on the SetLastError from Microsoft (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680627(v=vs.85).aspx)
* Support for the buffering to support the request object based on the nginx implementation (http://www.slideshare.net/joshzhu/nginx-internals)
* Apply the famous http parser of node.js http://github.com/ry/http-parser
* Support for huffman compression according to the implementation in the mariachi engine (http://code.google.com/p/mariachi/source/browse/src/hive_mariachi/algorithms/compression/huffman.h)
* Implement the memory pool structure based on the nginx implementation

== Refactor / Bug Fixing ==

* implement and refactor win32 conditions (_thread_win32.c) use this link http://thbecker.net/free_software_utilities/fair_monitor_for_win32/start_page.html

== Design decisions ==

* Create a structure similiar to the asynchronous model defined in the colony service implementations
* Separate the concept of service from the handler of the select (select_service does not make sensess)

== Target performance ==

* ab -n 10000 -c 100 -k http://servidor2.hive:9090/error should be able to rn at 45K-60K requests per second
* ab -n 10000 -c 100 -k  http://srio.hive:9090/eclipse should be able to run at 15K-24K requests per secondin raw power (not confirmed)
